# Starbucks-Capstone
Capstone project of Udacity DSND 

# Installation
Make sure you have already installed library sklearn, seaborn and tqdm. Except for these, the code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

# Project Motivation
For this project, given the Starbucks offer, customer profile, customer transaction data, I am going to:
1. Combine transaction, demographic and offer data to analyze which demographic groups respond(i.e.view&complete) best to which offer type;
2. Build a model that predicts whether or not someone will respond to an offer.

# File Description
There are 1 jupyter notebook file for the main analysis and 3 csv files as the input data(Starbucks offer, customer profile, customer transaction data, respectively).

# Results
For discussion 1, I have published a blog on <a href="https://medium.com/@harrygky/what-factors-may-affect-airbnbs-price-4bc4bedf5563">Medium</a>.
