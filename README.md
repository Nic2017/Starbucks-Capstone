# Starbucks-Capstone
Capstone project of Udacity DSND 
# Installation
Make sure you have already installed library seaborn and langdetect. Except for these, the code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

# Project Motivation
For this project, I use the Seattle AirBNB data to discuss:
1. The factors which affect the AirBNB price
2. Sentiment Analysis of Seattle AirBNB Reviews
Both of these can let us better understand the data given and have an overview of the status of Seattle AirBNB.

# File Description
There are 1 jupyter notebook file for the main analysis and 2 csv files as the input data(listings of BNB and reviews(zipped due to large size), separately).

# Results
For discussion 1, I have published a blog on <a href="https://medium.com/@harrygky/what-factors-may-affect-airbnbs-price-4bc4bedf5563">Medium</a>.
